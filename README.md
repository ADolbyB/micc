## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/ADolbyB/adolbyb.github.io/edit/main/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [Basic writing and formatting syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/ADolbyB/adolbyb.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

# Mary Immaculate Website

A website created and maintained by me for a church.

## DISCLAIMER: 
This website was created by me as a donation to a local church who's original site was deleted (maliciously, I believe). This is one of my personal portfolio projects and no money was exchanged for the work performed. All web services, the domain name, web hosting, and Bootstrap template license fees are paid for and donated by me.
