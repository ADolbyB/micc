# Mary Immaculate Website

A website created and maintained by me for a church.

## DISCLAIMER: This website was created by me as a donation to a local church who's original site was deleted (maliciously, I believe). This is one of my personal portfolio projects and no money was exchanged for the work performed. All web services, the domain name, web hosting, and Bootstrap template license fees are paid for and donated by me.
